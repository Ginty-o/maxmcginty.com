    <p>FIRST robotics is a K-12 international extracurricular "STEM" (science technology engineering mathematics) education program. I personally have been a part of the program since I was 9 years of old.
    During this time I was inspired to pursue my current interest of aerospace engineering. FIRST is a great program that requires students to learn and use many soft skills related
    to manufacturing and design. Examples of such soft skills are CADD, CAM, and machining experience. The fruits of that learning are shown here in the high school level of FIRST Robotics.
        There are many more aspects to the program which can be found <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">here</a>.</p>

        year for my high school team. We managed to become 8th in the word out of many thousands of teams. The game required the robot to be able to grab garbage cans
        and totes to make stacks. Our robot utilised our own proprietary lift mechanism and mechanum drive system for high agility and speed which allowed us to succeed
        as much as we did.</p></div>

            competing at the michigan's state level competition. The Game required traversing difficult terrain and precision shooting. Our team was able to achieve both
            goals with a powerful 6 wheal drive system and high speed wheel based single axis ball shooter. 2016 and each following year I was on the small 3 man team operating
            the robot in the heat of competition.</p></div>

        successful year where my team made it to the state level competition. 2017's game was regrettably poor, the game mainly required the robots to cycle
        gear shaped game peaces from one end of the field to another. This was achieved with a very simple 4 wheel drive train and a receptacle on my team's robot.
        Unfortunately there is little to talk about mechanically.</p></div>

        year for me team, making it to the world level competition in detroit. This robot was required to quickly cycle milk crate sized cubes into scales
        to gain points. The 2018 robot was by far the most impressive robot my team has ever created with an extremely fast fork lift style elevator, powerful
        wheel based cube intake, and an omni wheel drive system which allowed the robot to fully rotate in under a second. All impressive feats which were complimented
        with an abnormally high durability for a FIRST robot.</p></div>
