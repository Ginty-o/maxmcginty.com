    <h3 class="w3-center">About</h3>
    <p> Every one needs a hobby however, I wanted to test my skills at the same time and gain experience. I set out to build a hexa-copter at the begining of the summer of 2017
        that was able to carry a 3kg payload and still have good flight characteristics, the frame must also beat out or match current frames in flight characteristics and weight.
        I also hoped that the drone could be assembled very easily with few tools and easily manufactured so that other people could recreate my design if I wanted to market it.
        Lofty goals, but now that I have completed the project I am quite happy with the results.</p>

        <div class="w3-half w3-padding-16"><p>After selecting electronics that manufacturer spec'd to suit my needs I went into CADD to begin conception of a design.
        It was very apparent that the items I ordered would necessitate me building a <b>huge</b> drone. I opted to create a coaxial drone design to avoid
        the massive size my 16in propellers required. This also gained me redundancy in case of motor failure and large weight savings. I recognised that
        taking this route this would hurt my efficiency but I believe it was well made up for in-light of the benefits.</p></div>

        <div class="w3-half w3-padding-16"><p>While designing the drone I was given access to use an industrial laser cutter. I was lucky enough to have a well trained
        staff at a local advanced machining shop willing to train me on how to use the device and use the CAM software for it. This greatly sped up my machining
        time for the frame and reduced my tolerances. I'm far from certified for such a machine, but I was lucky to learn how to operate it thanks to
        Trimete Industries in Traverse City.</p></div>

        <div class="w3-half w3-padding-16"><p>Unfortunately I wasn't able to get all of the drone cut from sheet metal but luckily my father finished a CNC router from Open Builds.
        I was able to mill the rest of the sheet metal pieces I needed with this. Luckily it maintained good tolerances. With some calculations and careful babying was able
        to mill with a 1/16in of an inch end-mill in tempered aluminum.</p></div>

        <div class="w3-half w3-padding-16"><p>After a year of on and off building the drone is finally ready for PID tuning and flight. This picture is after its maiden flight and
        after its first crash too. Luckily the frame held up with minimal damage. My future plans for this drone is for DSLR camera gimble and autonomous flight with GPS.</p></div>
